            <h1>Fullstack Developer & DevOps Enthusiast</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Kanav Gathe! I recently completed my Bachelor's in Engineering in Computer Science and Engineering in July 2023. I have a strong passion for MERN Fullstack development and DevOps. Currently, I'm focusing on honing my skills in React and Express while working as a freelance web developer. I create simple, functional websites for those in need and aspire to secure a role in DevOps or Fullstack development. Explore my projects and get in touch to learn more about my work and how I can contribute to your team.</p>
